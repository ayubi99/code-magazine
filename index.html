    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>

      programming language).

      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites. In HTML, each element is made up of
      3 parts:

      <li>The actual element</li>
      <li>
